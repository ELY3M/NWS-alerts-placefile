BUT NOVEMBER\nPRECIPITATION WAS ABOVE NORMAL IN MOST LOCATIONS...MORE THAN 200\nPERCENT OF NORMAL ACROSS NORTHERN CHIPPEWA COUNTY AND IN THE\nHIGHER TERRAIN OF EASTERN ANTRIM/WESTERN OTSEGO/NORTHWEST KALKASKA\nCOUNTIES MAINLY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT LAKE EFFECT SNOW EVENT DURING\nTHANKSGIVING WEEKEND.\n\nDECEMBER PRECIPITATION WAS ABOVE NORMAL IN MOST AREAS...WITH THE\nHEAVIEST PRECIPITATION (150 TO 200+ PERCENT OF NORMAL)\nCONCENTRATED OVER THE TYPICAL NORTHWEST FLOW LAKE EFFECT SNOW\nAREAS.

LIQUID\nEQUIVALENT PRECIPITATION SO FAR THIS MONTH IS RUNNING ABOVE\nNORMAL FOR MOST AREAS...WITH 200 TO 300 PERCENT OF NORMAL ACROSS\nINTERIOR NORTHERN LOWER FROM M-55 NORTH TO M-32.\n\nSOIL MOISTURE IS NEAR NORMAL ACROSS EASTERN UPPER AND FAR NORTHERN\nLOWER MICHIGAN (NORTH OF M-32) AND IN THE 20TH TO 30TH PERCENTILE\nELSEWHERE.
